                                        Proteins are large, complex molecules that play many critical roles in the body. They do most of the work in cells required for the structure, function, and regulation of the bodyâ€™s tissues and organs.
                                        <br /><br />
                                        Genes direct the production of proteins through transcription, where information from DNA is passed to mRNA, followed by translation, where a ribosome reads the mRNA sequences (codons) and assembles the protein with corresponding amino acids.
                                        <br /><br />
                                        This tool lets you enter any mRNA codon and shows you information about the amino acid it encodes for.
